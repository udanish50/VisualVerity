The study conforms to the ethical guidelines of the Tri-Council Policy Statement Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS2), the Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA, 2004), and the applicable laws and regulations of Ontario. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of responses from a demography questionnaire and various AI-generated images evaluated by participants. Here are some highlights of the dataset:

### Demography Questionnaire

The following questions were asked to participants to understand their background:

- **Gender**
- **Age**
- **Educational Qualification**
- **Experience with AI or Computer-Generated Images**
- **Frequency of viewing digital images or graphics**
- **Experience in graphic design, photography, or related fields**
- **Country of residence**

### Respondent Profiles

Respondent profiles are summarized based on their responses to the demographic questions, providing insights into the diversity and background of the study participants.

## Survey Components

### Photorealism

This component evaluates how realistically AI-generated images mimic real-world visuals. Questions focus on the natural appearance of images, the authenticity of details, and the believability of textures and lighting.

### Image Quality

This section assesses the technical aspects of image clarity, including sharpness, color accuracy, and the presence of any digital artifacts. It gauges overall visual appeal and how well the images meet expected quality standards for various uses.

### Text-Image Alignment

This part examines the coherence between the text descriptions and the AI-generated images. It assesses how accurately the images reflect the described content, ensuring that the visuals and text are harmoniously aligned.

## Research Objectives

The study aims to:

1. Analyze architectural variances and output quality of advanced AI generative models.
2. Evaluate generated image models using a mix of objective (statistical and pre-trained model based) and subjective metrics.
3. Develop and validate a subjective metric that considers human judgment as the ground truth.
4. Assess the variation of output from selected models against objective and subjective metrics.

## Tables and Findings

Responses from participants across various metrics are detailed, providing insights into human perception of photorealism, image quality, and text-image alignment in both camera-generated and AI-generated images.

## Discussion and Implications

The findings highlight the challenges and opportunities in using subjective assessments to evaluate AI-generated images. The study underscores the need for robust, human-centered metrics that align more closely with human visual perception.
