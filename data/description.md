# Dataset Descriptions

This document provides detailed descriptions of each dataset file included in the repository. These datasets form the core of our study on human evaluations of AI-generated images, focusing on three key aspects: photorealism, image quality, and text-image alignment.

## Files and Descriptions

### `study1.csv`
**File Description:**  
This dataset contains the initial responses from participants regarding the photorealism aspect of AI-generated images. It includes participants' evaluations of how realistic the images appear compared to real-world objects or scenes. Metrics such as perceived realism, detail authenticity, and naturalness of textures are quantified based on participants' scores.

### `study2.csv`
**File Description:**  
This file houses data related to the image quality assessment conducted in the study. It captures scores that reflect the technical quality of images, including sharpness, color accuracy, and absence of artifacts. This dataset helps in understanding the overall visual appeal and technical sufficiency of the AI-generated images as judged by the participants.

### `study3.csv`
**File Description:**  
Focused on text-image alignment, this dataset records participants' ratings on how well the text descriptions match the AI-generated images. It assesses the coherence between the visual content and its accompanying text description, reflecting on the communicative effectiveness of images in conveying the intended message.
